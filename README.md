Culinary AI Assistant üç≥ü§ñ
Welcome to the Culinary AI Assistant, an intelligent web application designed to be your personal kitchen helper. This app uses the power of generative AI to help you discover new recipes based on the ingredients you already have. Just upload a photo of your ingredients, and let the AI chef do the rest!

This project is a full-stack application built with a modern technology stack, showcasing best practices in web development, API design, and AI integration.

üåü Core Features
Secure User Authentication: Full user registration and login system using secure JWTs.

AI Ingredient Recognition: Users can upload a photo of their ingredients, which are then identified by the Gemini Vision AI.

Dynamic AI Recipe Generation: Based on the identified ingredients, our AI Chef (powered by the Gemini Language Model) generates a unique, delicious recipe complete with a description, prep/cook times, and step-by-step instructions.

Professional, Responsive UI: A modern and clean user interface built with React that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

Fully Containerized: The entire application (Frontend, Backend, Database) is containerized with Docker for easy setup, consistency, and deployment.
